                    I have spent
                    <b>wayyyyy</b> too much time both customizing VS Code to my
                    liking and configuring it to work with the language that I
                    need for a project.

                    VS Code itself recommending to install Visual Studios for C#
                    support? Nah, just spend 5 hours figuring out how to
                    bootstrap C# autocompletion on VSCode. Nothing can beat the
                    insane amount of extensions that truly add life to your code
                    editor.
