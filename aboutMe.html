                            I will die on the hill that VS Code is the best code
                            editor on the planet.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            I have spent
                            <b>wayyyyy</b> too much time both customizing VS
                            Code to my liking and configuring it to work with
                            the language that I need for a project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            VS Code itself recommending to install Visual
                            Studios for C# support? Nah, just spend 5 hours
                            figuring out how to bootstrap C# autocompletion on
                            VSCode. Nothing can beat the insane amount of
                            extensions that truly add life to your code editor.
