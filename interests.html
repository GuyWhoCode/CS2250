        <p>
            I'm absolutely engrossed in the Star Wars Universe. I've watched
            numerous videos explaining the extended lore through the comics,
            video games, and TV shows. I'm currently watching <em>Ahsoka</em>!
            If you haven't watched Star Wars content recently, I highly
            recommend <i>Andor</i>. The picture above is taken from one of the
            scenes.

        <p>
            In my spare time, I like watching YouTube, particularly content from
            Offline TV (OTV). They're a group of streamers that do different
            activities together beyond gaming in their streams.
